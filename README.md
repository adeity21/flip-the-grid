This code sample is an interactive flip-the-grid game where you can test how much your memory can hold. 
You need to click on the existing cards to flip them. The score board will automatically update your score as you keep selecting the same cards that match. 
This game has been built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
I used for loops, addEventListener, setAttribute, getAttribute, data-name, document.querySelector, createElement, Sort and math.random inbuilt functions.
I used as many in-built functions as I could to make the code short, to the point and easy to understand.

Hope you enjoy the game!
